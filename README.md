# Arabian-Nights-Companion-App
A small companion app for the Z-Man board game called Tales of the Arabian Nights. This project is intended to make the experience of encounters in the game more streamlined. Eventually, this will turn into an iPhone and/or Android app.

The current plan for this app is to merely streamline the Encounters experience, but the conceptual final version will basically be a full implementation of the game in the form of an app.
